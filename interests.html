        <h2>Some details of a few of my hobbies</h2>
             <h3>Skiing</h3>
                <p>
                     I have been skiing since I was two years old. Growing up my dad taught me how to ski, our entire family went skiing every saturday
                    while I was growing up. So skiing is in my blood. My wife Kourtney is the same way. She grew up skiing every saturday with her family. 
                    So we are just a skiing family, we are now teaching our little boy how to ski and I am looking foward to the day that we will all ski 
                    together as a family.

            <h3>Biking</h3>
                <p>
                    In the summer I really enjoy biking both mountain biking and road biking. Unlike skiing I didnt do much biking in my younger
                    years. This is something I have just picked up in the last 5 or so years. I started biking just to stay in shape for skiing in 
                    winter and I would rather be outside working out than stuck in a smelly gym with a whole bunch of other sweaty people. Although 
                    I started biking just to stay in shape I have really grown to love biking and look forward to it in the summer.
                </p>
            <h3>Traveling with my Family</h3>
                <p>
                    Traveling with my family is one of my all time favorites. Back before my wife and I had kids we would take a bunch of random 
                    trips and it was so fun. Those are still some of my funnest trips and memories. One summer we packed up in a day or so and took
                    a random trip to Canada to watch the US womens soccer team play in the world cup, it was really spur of the moment but was a really
                    fun trip. I look forward to doing things like that again but maybe once our kids get a little older.
