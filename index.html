                <p>Hi my name is Bryan Bond. While I wish I had a uncle named James I just want to put out a disclaimer that I have no relation 
            to <strong>James Bond</strong> or maybe one day I will find it, time will tell. I live in Ogden, Utah and have lived here my entire life. I 
            have spent some time in the islands of the south pacific which was amazing. I am married to my wife Kourtney and have two <strong>amazing</strong>
            children named Bode and Lottie. I <em>love</em> to ski in the winter and ride bikes in the summer. I also love spending time with my family,
            traveling and of course learning more about tech. 
                </p>

            <img id="bryan" src="Assets/Images/Bryan Bond Picture.jpg" alt="Picture of Bryan Bond" widht="250" height="200"/>
        </div>
                <p>A little bit more about me professionally I have been in Sales and Marketing for the past eight years. I have worked in many
            different fields including technology, healthcare, industrial, and the ski industry. I have really enjoyed most places I have 
            worked. I have always enjoyed tech and just felt like I wanted to try something different from sales and marketing so I looked
            into web dev and felt like this was an avenue I wanted to pursue to see where it could take me. 
            As they say <q>Life begins when at the end of your confort zone</q> While this is new to me I am looking forward to continue learning it.
                 </p>
