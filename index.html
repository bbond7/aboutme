        <h1>Bond, Bryan Bond</h1>
            <p>Hi my name is Bryan Bond. While I wish I had a uncle named James I just want to put out a disclaimer that I have no relation 
            to James Bond or maybe one day I will find it, time will tell. I live in Ogden, Utah and have lived here my entire life. I 
            have spent some time in the islands of the south pacific which was amazing. I am married to my wife Kourtney and have two amazing 
            children named Bode and Lottie. I love to ski in the winter and ride bikes in the summer. I also love spending time with my family,
            traveling and of course learning more about tech. </p>

            <p>A little bit more about me professionally I have been in Sales and Marketing for the past 8 years. I have worked in many
            different fields including technology, healthcare, industrial, and the ski industry. I have really enjoyed most places I have 
            worked. I have always enjoyed tech and just felt like I wanted to try something different from sales and marketing so I looked
            into web dev and felt like this was an avenue I wanted to pursue to see where it could take me. I am excited to be on this ride. 
            </p>
