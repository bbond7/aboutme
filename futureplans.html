            <h2>Professional Future Plans</h2>
                <p>
                This class of Web Development plays a bit role in where I see myself in the future and what my future plans are. 
                I am planning on graduating with my certificate of Web Development from Neumont in June. Once I get my certificate I am 
                looking to get a job to gain some experience in Web Development. As I am working I plan to finish up my bachelors degree 
                in Web Development or Software Engineering. Which ever one I can get done the quickest. Eventually, I would like to have my
                own business and do freelance Web Development for clients. 
                </p>
            <h2>Personal Future Plans</h2>
                <p>
                My personal future plans evolve around my family. We really love to travel and be able to spend time in awesome places
                of the world. So one of our future plans is to be able to travel more and to be able to both have jobs that allow us to
                be flexible and travel and spend time in different parts of the world. Although traveling is fun and we are planning on
                doing it as much as we can we will always have our home base here in Utah. These mountains and the Utah snow is just to 
                good to leave.
