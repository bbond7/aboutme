            <h2>Websites of Today</h2>
                <p> In the age of today websites are second nature to all of us. We access our favorite websites each day and many times we may not even
    know it, it has just become second nature to us. We all have our favorite websites that we access each day. They can pretty much be
    anything from where we get news, social media, play games, have fun and much much more. With all the websites out there here are a few
    of my favorites.

    These are websites that I pretty much visit everyday. Most of these websites are informational, they provide me with information 
    to many of the things I like such as skiing, sports and news. Some of them are just fun to go to as well, we all love losing hours upon hours
    watching youtube and eventually saying "how did we just watch Youtube videos for 2 hours." At least we had a great time doing it.
